## Before You Push to GitHub

### CRITICAL: Add GitHub Secrets First! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Go to: **Repository Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**

#### Add These 5 Secrets:

1. **DB_USERNAME**
   - Value: `laravel_user`

2. **DB_PASSWORD**
   - Value: `password` (or your preferred password)

3. **DB_DATABASE**
   - Value: `notes_db`

4. **DOCKER_USERNAME**
   - Value: Your Docker Hub username
   - Example: `johndoe`

5. **DOCKER_TOKEN**
   - Value: Docker Hub Personal Access Token
   - Get it from: https://hub.docker.com ‚Üí Account Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí New Access Token
   - Permissions: Read, Write, Delete

---

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Test on Feature Branch First ‚úì RECOMMENDED

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions"

# Push to test branch FIRST (safer)
git push origin Testing-Doc-Branch
```

**What This Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Workflow syntax is correct
- ‚úÖ All tests pass in GitHub Actions environment
- ‚úÖ Dependencies install correctly
- ‚úÖ Database migrations work
- ‚úÖ Code style checks pass

**What This Does NOT Do:**
- ‚ùå Does not push to Docker Hub (only happens on main)
- ‚ùå Does not deploy anything
- ‚úÖ Safe to test without consequences

### Phase 2: After Test Branch Success, Push to Main

```bash
# Switch to main
git checkout main

# Merge the tested changes
git merge Testing-Doc-Branch

# Push to main (triggers full pipeline with Docker deployment)
git push origin main
```

**What This Does:**
- ‚úÖ Runs all tests again
- ‚úÖ Builds Docker image
- ‚úÖ Pushes to Docker Hub with tags:
  - `latest`
  - `main`
  - `main-<commit-sha>`

---

## Expected Pipeline Duration

### First Run (No Cache):
- **Feature Branches**: 8-12 minutes
- **Main Branch**: 11-17 minutes (includes Docker build)

### Subsequent Runs (With Cache):
- **Feature Branches**: 4-6 minutes
- **Main Branch**: 6-9 minutes

---

## Monitoring the Pipeline

### Watch Real-Time:
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Click on the running workflow
4. Expand each step to see logs

### Success Indicators:
- üü¢ All steps show green checkmarks
- ‚úÖ "Tests: 8 passed (23 assertions)"
- ‚úÖ "Docker image pushed successfully" (main branch only)

### If Something Fails:
1. Click on the failed step
2. Read the error message
3. Most common issues:
   - Missing GitHub Secrets
   - Test failures (fix locally first)
   - Docker Hub authentication (check token)

---

## Quick Commands Reference

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Start containers
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
docker-compose exec app php artisan test

# Check code style
docker-compose exec app ./vendor/bin/pint --test

# View logs
docker-compose logs app --tail=50

# Stop containers
docker-compose down
```

### Git Commands:
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline"

# Push to test branch
git push origin Testing-Doc-Branch

# Push to main (after testing)
git push origin main
```

### After Pipeline Success:
```bash
# Pull the image from Docker Hub
docker pull your-username/laravel-notes-app:latest

# Run it
docker run -p 8080:9000 your-username/laravel-notes-app:latest
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "Secret DB_USERNAME not found"
**Fix:** Add all 5 secrets in GitHub Settings ‚Üí Secrets

### Issue: Tests fail in CI but pass locally
**Cause:** Environment difference
**Fix:** Check the failed step logs, usually database connection

### Issue: Docker Hub push fails
**Fix:** 
- Verify DOCKER_USERNAME is exact (case-sensitive)
- Regenerate DOCKER_TOKEN with write permissions
- Ensure Docker Hub repository exists (or enable auto-create)

### Issue: Workflow doesn't appear in Actions tab
**Fix:** 
- Ensure file is at `.github/workflows/laravel-ci-cd.yml`
- Check YAML syntax (indentation matters!)
- Push the changes to GitHub

---

## Success Criteria ‚úì

Your pipeline is working correctly when:

- [x] Local tests pass (8/8)
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow appears in Actions tab
- [ ] All pipeline steps complete successfully
- [ ] Tests pass in CI environment
- [ ] Docker image builds (main branch)
- [ ] Image appears in Docker Hub (main branch)
- [ ] Three tags created: latest, main, main-sha

---

## What Happens on Each Branch

### On `Testing-Doc-Branch`, `Docker-Branch`, `CI-CD-Branch`:
1. ‚úÖ Run all tests
2. ‚úÖ Check code quality
3. ‚úÖ Build frontend assets
4. ‚ùå **NO** Docker deployment
5. ‚úÖ Provide feedback on PR/commit

### On `main` Branch:
1. ‚úÖ Run all tests
2. ‚úÖ Check code quality
3. ‚úÖ Build frontend assets
4. ‚úÖ **YES** Build Docker image
5. ‚úÖ **YES** Push to Docker Hub
6. ‚úÖ Tag with latest, main, and commit SHA

### On Pull Requests to `main`:
1. ‚úÖ Run all tests
2. ‚úÖ Check code quality
3. ‚ùå **NO** Docker deployment
4. ‚úÖ Block merge if tests fail

---

## Final Steps - Ready to Deploy!

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
```
Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/settings/secrets/actions
Add all 5 secrets listed above
```

### Step 2: Test Locally One More Time
```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan test
# Should show: Tests: 8 passed
```

### Step 3: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Configured MySQL service container for tests
- Added Docker build and push to Docker Hub on main branch
- Updated environment configuration for CI/CD
- Added comprehensive documentation and test scripts"
```

### Step 4: Push to Test Branch First
```bash
git push origin Testing-Doc-Branch
```

### Step 5: Monitor in GitHub Actions
```
Watch the pipeline run and verify all tests pass
```

### Step 6: After Success, Merge to Main
```bash
git checkout main
git merge Testing-Doc-Branch
git push origin main
```

### Step 7: Verify Docker Hub Deployment
```
Go to https://hub.docker.com/r/YOUR_USERNAME/laravel-notes-app
Confirm image and tags are present
```
